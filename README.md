# videozeromqrelay

The videozeromqrelay can be used in parallel with the Android application: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dobots.zmqvideochat">ZMQ Video Chat</a>.

It serves images over a REST API, with simple GET /image requests so you can use it subsequently in a webpage.
